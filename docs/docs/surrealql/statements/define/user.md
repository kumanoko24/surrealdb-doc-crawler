# DEFINE USER statement


Use the `DEFINE USER` statement to create system users on SurrealDB

###### Note


While existing logins still function, the DEFINE LOGIN statement has been replaced with DEFINE USER.

## Requirements


- You must be authenticated with a user that has enough permissions. Only the OWNER built-in role grants permissions to create users.
- You must be authenticated with a user that has permissions on the level where you are creating the user:Root users with owner permissions can create Root, Namespace and Database users.Namespace users with owner permissions can create Namespace and Database usersDatabase users with owner permissions can create Database users.
- To select the level where you want to create the user, you may need to select a namespace and/or database before you can use the DEFINE USER statement for database or namespace tokens.

###### Note


You cannot use the DEFINE USER statement to create a record user.

```

## Example usage


The following example shows how you can create a `ROOT` user using the `DEFINE USER` statement.

```
-- Create the user with an owner role and some example durationsDEFINE USER username ON ROOT PASSWORD '123456' ROLES OWNER DURATION FOR SESSION 15m, FOR TOKEN 5s;
```

Note that even a root-level user can be given a limited role such as `VIEWER`. This can be useful for automated services that need to monitor each namespace and database, or coworkers high up the org chart that are not particularly tech-savvy.

```
DEFINE USER birthday_bot ON ROOT PASSWORD "botpassword9!" ROLES VIEWER;DEFINE USER clumsy_ceo ON ROOT PASSWORD "password" ROLES VIEWER COMMENT "Don't let the CEO have more than VIEWER access";
```

The following example shows how you can create a `NAMESPACE` user using the `DEFINE USER` statement.

```
-- Specify the namespaceUSE NS abcum;-- Create the user with an editor role and some example durationsDEFINE USER username ON NAMESPACE PASSWORD '123456' ROLES EDITOR DURATION FOR SESSION 12h, FOR TOKEN 1m;
```

The following example shows how you can create a `DATABASE` user using the `DEFINE USER` statement.

```
-- Specify the namespace and database for the userUSE NS abcum DB app_vitalsense;-- Create the user with a viewer role and some example durationsDEFINE USER username ON DATABASE PASSWORD '123456' ROLES VIEWER DURATION FOR SESSION 5d, FOR TOKEN 2h;
```

## Using IF NOT EXISTS clause


The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause can be used to define a user only if it does not already exist. You should use the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause when defining a user in SurrealDB if you want to ensure that the user is only created if it does not already exist. If the user already exists, the `DEFINE USER` statement will return an error.

It's particularly useful when you want to safely attempt to define a user without manually checking its existence first.

On the other hand, you should not use the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause when you want to ensure that the user definition is updated regardless of whether it already exists. In such cases, you might prefer using the `OVERWRITE` clause, which allows you to define a user and overwrite an existing one if it already exists, ensuring that the latest version of the user definition is always in use

```
-- Create a USER if it does not already existDEFINE USER IF NOT EXISTS example ON ROOT PASSWORD "example" ROLES OWNER;
```

## Using OVERWRITE clause


The `OVERWRITE` clause can be used to define a user and overwrite an existing one if it already exists. You should use the `OVERWRITE` clause when you want to modify an existing user definition. If the user already exists, the `DEFINE USER` statement will overwrite the existing user definition with the new one.

```
-- Create an USER and overwrite if it already existsDEFINE USER OVERWRITE example ON ROOT PASSWORD "example" ROLES OWNER;
```

## Roles


Currently, only the built-in roles OWNER, EDITOR and VIEWER are available.

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| OWNER | Can view and edit any resource on the user's level or below, including user and token (IAM) resources.It also grants full permissions for child resources that support the PERMISSIONS clause (tables, fields, etc.) |
| EDITOR | Can view and edit any resource on the user's level or below, but not users or token (IAM) resourcesIt also grants full permissions for child resources that support the PERMISSIONS clause (tables, fields, etc.) |
| VIEWER | Grants permissions to view any resource on the user's level or below, but not edit.It also grants view permissions for child resources that support the PERMISSIONS clause (tables, fields, etc.) |


## Duration


The duration clause specifies the duration of the token returned after successful authentication with a password or passhash as well as the duration of the session established both using a password or passhash and the aforementioned token. The difference between these concepts is explained in the expiration documentation.
