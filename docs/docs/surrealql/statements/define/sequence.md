# DEFINE SEQUENCE statement


A sequence is used to generate reliable, monotonically increasing numeric sequences in both single-node and clustered SurrealDB deployments (multiple compute nodes backed by TiKV). It uses a batch-allocation strategy to minimise coordination while guaranteeing global uniqueness.

The key features of a sequence are as follows:

- Batch allocation: Nodes request ranges of sequence values at once, reducing network chatter and coordination overhead.
- Node ownership tagging: Every batch is tagged with the requesting node's UUID to prevent overlap between nodes.
- Durable Persistence: Sequence metadata is stored in the underlying key-value store to survive restarts and network partitions.
- Concurrent, thread-safe access: A DashMap caches active sequences, allowing lock-free reads on the hot path.
- Exponential back-off with full jitter: When a batch-allocation attempt fails, the node retries with an exponential delay that includes full jitter to avoid thundering-herd effects across the cluster.
- Automatic cleanup: Listens for namespace and database-removal events and purges the corresponding sequence state.

The sequence implementation avoids contention by having each node reserve a range of sequence values, allowing it to serve multiple requests locally without requiring distributed coordination for every request. When a node exhausts its allocated range, it acquires a new batch from the distributed store.

## Examples


A sequence can be created with nothing more than a name.

```
DEFINE SEQUENCE mySeq;
```

The `BATCH`, `START`, and `TIMEOUT` clauses can be included to configure the sequence.

```
DEFINE SEQUENCE mySeq2 BATCH 1000 START 100 TIMEOUT 5s;sequence::nextval('mySeq2');-- Output: 100DEFINE SEQUENCE mySeq3 BATCH 1000 START 100 TIMEOUT 0ns;sequence::nextval('mySeq3');-- Possible output: 'The query was not executed because it exceeded the timeout'
```

Sequences are never rolled back, even in a failed transaction. This differs from an approach like a single record with a manually incrementing value.

```
DEFINE SEQUENCE seq;CREATE my:counter SET val = 0;sequence::nextval("seq");        -- 0my:counter.val;                  -- 0BEGIN TRANSACTION;sequence::nextval("seq");        -- 0UPDATE my:counter SET val += 1;  -- my:counter.val = 1CANCEL TRANSACTION;              -- my:counter.val now rolled back to 0sequence::nextval("seq");        -- 2UPDATE my:counter SET val += 1;  -- 1
```
